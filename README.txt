-----CODE INFORMATION-----

The HomeHelpService.py file includes 3 versions of the same basic job assignment algorithm:
	- makeRandomAssignments(): completely random, no connections, used to test the main algorithm without delays of generating the interface and attemptng db connections
	- makeAPIAssignments(): once a connection is attempted then this method also tries to connect to the Google API by passing the key to calculate distance
	- makeNoAPIAssignmnets(): if no credit is availabel in the Google API Console, then use this method to calculate distance using the np.hypot() function

The HomeHelpService_Database.py when calling the runAlgorithm() function, if credit available in API console use the makeAPIAssignments() method otherwise comment 
out and use makeNoAPIAssignments() 


-----RUN CODE----------
 
To run the code run the following command:
	python HomeHelpService_API.py 


-----TEST CODE-------

To test the code, run the runTests.py file. 
	python runTests.py
Make sure you set the numeber of employees and clients (or the range to randomly generate them) in the HomeHelpService.py file
within the makeRandomAssignments() method as well as the number of times you want to test the algorithm by changing the range
within the runTests.py file
